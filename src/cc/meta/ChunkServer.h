// \file ChunkServer.h
// \brief Object that handles the communication with an individual
// chunk server. Model here is the following:
//  - For write-allocation, layout manager asks the ChunkServer object
// to send an RPC to the chunk server.
//  - The ChunkServer object sends the RPC and holds on to the request
// that triggered the RPC.
//  - Eventually, when the RPC reply is received, the request is
// re-activated (alongwith the response) and is sent back down the pike.
