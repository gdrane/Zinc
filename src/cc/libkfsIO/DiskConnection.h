/// \file DiskConnection.h
/// \brief A disk connection is modeled after a network connection on
/// which I/O can be done.
///
/// A disk connection is owned by a KfsCallbackObj.  Whenever the
/// KfsCallbackObj needs to do disk I/O, it schedules the operation on
/// the disk connection.  The disk connection uses the disk manager
/// (@see DiskManager) to schedule the I/O.  The disk manager calls
/// the connection back when the operation completes.  The disk
/// connection in turn calls back the KfsCallbackObj with the result.
///

///
/// To allow pipelining of disk IO operations, particularly READ
/// requests---where a client can break-down the read requests into
/// multiple requests so that we can overlap disk/network
/// transfer---have a structure that tracks the status of individual
/// IO requests.  A DiskConnection keeps a queue of such outstanding
/// requests.
