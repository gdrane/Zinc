// \brief In a multi-threaded setup, the net-manager runs on a
// separate thread.  It has a poll loop with a delay of N secs; during
// this time, any messages generated interally maybe held waiting for
// the net-manager thread to wake up.  This has the effect of
// introducing N sec delay for sending outbound messages.  To force
// the net-manager to wake up, create a "net kicker" object and write
// some data to it.  That is, create a pipe and make the pipe fd part
// of the net-manager's poll loop; whenever we write data to the pipe,
// the net-manager will wake up and service out-bound messages.
