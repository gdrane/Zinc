/// Accepting a TCP connection consists of two pieces:
///
///   1. Setting up a TCP socket and marking it for listen: This is
/// handled by the Acceptor.
///
///   2.  Once a connection is received, "doing something" with it:
/// This is handled by the IAcceptorOwner.
///

///
/// \class IAcceptorOwner
/// Abstract class defines the interface that must be implemented by an
/// owner of an acceptor object.

    /// Callback that will be invoked whenever a new connection is
    /// received.  The callback is expected to create a continuation
    /// and return that as the result.

    /// that was received.  @see NetConnectionPtr
    ///
