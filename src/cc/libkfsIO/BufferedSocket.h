// \brief Helper class that has a socket with a buffer.  This enables
// API such as readLine() where we read N bytes from the socket,
// return a line and leave the rest buffered for subsequent access.
// NOTE: This class only does buffered I/O for reads; for writes, it
// is all pass-thru to the TcpSocket class.
