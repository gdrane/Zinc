// \brief A lease clerk interacts with the metaserver for renewing
// leases.  There are two assumptions here:
// 1. The lease is for writes and only those need to be renewed
// 2. Prior to renewing a lease, the lease clerk checks with the
// ChunkManager to see if writes are outstanding on the chunk
// associated with the lease; only if writes are pending, is the lease
// renewed.
