INTRODUCTION
============

This document describes how to use KFS.  In particular, how to
load/unload data from KFS servers; the set of tools that are available
to view the filesystem tree.

TOOLS SOURCE/BINARIES
=====================

The source code for all the tools included in the package is at:
~/code/kfs/src/cc/tools

When the package is compiled and installed, the tools are installed
in: ~/code/kfs/build/bin/tools

LOADING/UNLOADING DATA
======================

To load pre-existing data files into KFS, the data needs to be copied
in to a KFS deployment.   
 - cpFs2Kfs is a tool that copies a directory hierarchy from a local
 filesystem to a KFS; this tool creates a corresponding directory
 hierarchy in KFS

When loading data into KFS, you can run multiple instances of cpFs2Kfs
to speed up the copy; each instance copies in a portion of the
directory tree.

For debugging purposes, data can also copied out from KFS to a local
filesystem:
 - cpKfs2Fs is a tool that copies a directory hierarchy from KFS
 to a local filesystem; this tool creates a corresponding directory
 hierarchy in the local filesystem

These tools take arguments from the command line.  
Type: <tool name> -h to see the list of options for that tool.

FILE SYSTEM TOOLS
=================

To manipulate the KFS directory tree, KfsShell tool is provided.
This tool provides a basic set of filesystem commands such as
 - mkdir, rmdir, rm, cd, cp, mv, ls

SCRIPTING SUPPORT
=================

To manipulate the KFS directory tree from a script, commands can be
"piped" to the KfsShell tool.  For instance, to create a directory:
  mkdir foo | KfsShell -q -m <metaserver host> -p <metaserver port>
